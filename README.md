Â <h1>Bayesian inference for Dose-Response Analysis (BiDRA)</h1>

BiDRA is a user-friendly web interface for dose-response curves analysis. 

The interface is available through this URL: https://bidra.bioinfo.iric.ca/

We describe our Bayesian approach in this paper: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i464/5529233

The code for BiDRA as presented at ISMB 2019 can be found in the ``ismb_2019``branch. Current developments are added to the ``master``branch.
