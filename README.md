Â <h1>Bayesian inference for Dose-Response Analysis (BiDRA)</h1>

BiDRA is a user-friendly web interface for dose-response curves analysis. 
The interface is available through this URL: https://bidra.bioinfo.iric.ca/
We describe our Bayesian approach in this paper, presented at ISMB 2019: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i464/5529233
